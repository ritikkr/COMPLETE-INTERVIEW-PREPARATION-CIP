    \   /
    Forward
       |
    Birdirectional
        |
    Random

These 5 operators are only logical classifications of iterators there is no such class exists for them.

Input iterators allows you to read input not to write any things.
Ouput iterators allows you to write only.
Forward iterators have capabilities of read and write and move Forward only.
Birdirectional iterators have capabilities of Forward + moves backward;
Random acess iterators have all capabilities of Birdirectional iterators and you can get nth item and you can compare two iterators.
